Hello samachar27.com Administrator!

Cool website!

My name‚Äôs Eric, and I just found your site - samachar27.com - while surfing the net. You showed up at the top of the search results, so I checked you out. Looks like what you‚Äôre doing is pretty cool.
 
But if you don‚Äôt mind me asking ‚Äì after someone like me stumbles across samachar27.com, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business? 
 
I‚Äôm guessing some, but I also bet you‚Äôd like more‚Ä¶ studies show that 7 out 10 who land on a site wind up leaving without a trace.

Not good.

Here‚Äôs a thought ‚Äì what if there was an easy way for every visitor to ‚Äúraise their hand‚Äù to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY‚Ä¶ the second they hit your site and said, ‚Äúcall me now.‚Äù

You can ‚Äì
  
Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that‚Äôs works on your site, ready to capture any visitor‚Äôs Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It lets you know IMMEDIATELY ‚Äì so that you can talk to that lead while they‚Äôre literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads ‚Äì the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later can be huge ‚Äì like 100 times better!

That‚Äôs why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead feature‚Ä¶ because once you‚Äôve captured the visitor‚Äôs phone number, you can automatically start a text message (SMS) conversation.
  
Think about the possibilities ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt close a deal then and there, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just ‚Äúhow you doing?‚Äù notes to build a relationship.

Wouldn‚Äôt that be cool?

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to discover what Web Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Eric

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial ‚Äì and it even includes International Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to talk with you right now‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt keep them waiting.
