Comment: 
To the samachar27.com Owner! 

Eric here with a quick thought about your website samachar27.com...

I‚Äôm on the internet a lot and I look at a lot of business websites.

Like yours, many of them have great content. 

But all too often, they come up short when it comes to engaging and connecting with anyone who visits.

I get it ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard.  Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace.  You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here‚Äôs a solution for you‚Ä¶

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that‚Äôs works on your site, ready to capture any visitor‚Äôs Name, Email address and Phone Number.  You‚Äôll know immediately they‚Äôre interested and you can call them directly to talk with them literally while they‚Äôre still on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE http://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

It could be huge for your business ‚Äì and because you‚Äôve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation ‚Äì immediately‚Ä¶ and contacting someone in that 5 minute window is 100 times more powerful than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers, content links, even just follow up notes to keep the conversation going.

Everything I‚Äôve just described is extremely simple to implement, cost-effective, and profitable. 
 
CLICK HERE http://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial ‚Äì and it even includes International Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to talk with you right now‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt keep them waiting.
